1. What's your favourite front end programming framework and why?
I have really liked Next.JS lately, it has been really simple to set up and ran pretty much out of the box!

2. Which cloud service provider is your favourite and why?
I have always used AWS, they have such a vast array of services and products at such a tiny cost. I do prefer Firebase for pushes and realtime DB though as their setup is a lot eaiser. AWS's documentation can be very opaque as it is obviously automatically generated.

3. What is your preferred approach to testing software?
I do try and stick to TDD, especially for back end logic (you will notice I haven't tested my tech test as I did not ahve the time and the majority of my implementation is 3rd part services, so I would have just been testing a load of mocks)

4. Please provide your views and any relevant experience you have with devops, including web and mobile CI/CD:
I have worked on CI pipelines using GitHub actions most recently. I built scripts for pushing over-the-air updates for our expo mobile app. I have also written AWS CDK scripts to build serverless applications (using Lambda, API gateway, IAM etc)

5. What are the three most important things to you about your next project or role you undertake?
a. Tech-for-good: I would rather work on projects/products that are trying to make the world a better place (no gambling/crypto)
b. Scope for growth: I would rather be in a small team that is looking to expand than a large organisation, and on a green-field project rather than an established products
c. Good working culture: one of my most proud achievements from my current role was building out a team of awesome people and really enjoying the work we do and the team we do it with.
