## Developer Challenge

So we can get to know you better and understand your technical skills in more detail, we'd like to see how you tackle new challenges.

_Note: This task should take approximately 3 - 4 hours. If you're finding it's taking longer than that, please feel free to pause where you are and submit what you have, and add some notes to document where you got to and indicate what your next steps would be._

### Preparation

Before starting this task, we recommend that you have:

- Your favourite computer and development tools / IDE to hand;
- A few hours of un-distracted time ahead of you;
- Access to the internet;
- A strong coffee (or mug of tea, if you prefer!).

### In this task, you may use:

- Any packages or dependencies that you feel are necessary;
- Any 3rd-party APIs or services that you feel are necessary;
- Any other combination of technologies, frameworks and techniques you like;
- The internet, including Google, Stackoverflow etc.

You may also ask us any general questions you might have about the task.

## The Challenge

Incoming request!! - an account manager on your team has an urgent request from a key client:

The client has had a brilliant new idea for a disruptive video streaming app, but they're not sure how feasible it will be to develop the concept.

As a priority, they need to de-risk the technical side of the idea by building a sample proof-of-concept app which they can demo to their executive board to prove that the idea they've got would be technically possible.

And good news - they've asked you to help!

### Requirements:

The must-have feature requirements of the app are:

1. To allow at least 2 people to connect to a live video call and have a conversation;
2. For the call to take place within a custom web OR mobile app, such that the experience surrounding the call _could_ be completely customised (the actual level of customisation is up to you, but the important point is that it could be fully customised);
3. All participants should be able to:
   - Specify at least their first name when they join the call
   - Leave the call by clicking a button within the app (i.e. not just by closing the browser or app)

### Setting up

1. Fork this repository on Github (if you don't know what that means or how to do it, Google is your friend);
2. Create a `src` folder within the repo to contain your new code.

### Task 1: Building the app:

Create a simple app to fulfil the requirements described above within your forked repo.

### Task 2: A few questions:

Please update the `questions.txt` file with your answers to the questions.

### Wrapping things up

When you're finished, please:

1. Push your code to your forked repository; and
2. Send us a pull request.

If you wish to supply instructions on how to run or understand the construction of your code, then please provide those in a new README.md file within a `docs` folder.

Once we've received your pull request, we'll merge your code. Your submission will then be reviewed by one of our senior technical team and we will get back to you.

If you can provide a link to a demo of your app to go along with your code, then all the better.

### For bonus points:

If you find the task above easy, then feel free to improve your app. Here are some ideas:

- Add a timer to the call so participants know how long they've been on it;
- Allow participants to share their screen during the call;
- Allow participants to contribute to a live chat / messaging stream during the call.

### Hints:

We are not expecting you to build an entire video calling software app from scratch, nor to build out a solid application. This is task is more about piecing together existing tools, libraries and frameworks to get a working prototype up and running.

You may find these tools helpful ;-)

- <a href="https://www.amity.co/" target="_blank">Amity</a>
- <a href="https://sendbird.com/" target="_blank">Send bird</a>

Note: some of the tools above even include quick-start examples that can get you up and running in a flash. If you choose to leverage the quick start examples to find a solution that works, it would be great if you can "cherry pick" the required code into your sample app and get it working in your "clean" app rather than wholesale copying and submitting an open source sample app ;-)

### Any questions?

Please just ask.

Good luck and thank you for taking the time to complete this task!
